# Introduction

The RC Car Project is a collaborative effort to provide a comprehensive guide and resources for building a remote-controlled car from scratch. From the selection of materials to the final customization, this project aims to offer an engaging and educational experience for individuals interested in the world of DIY RC cars.

# Materials

Here is a list of materials used in the RC Car Project:
check out the BOM for more information.

1. 3D printing filament(TPU) *in case you want to print parts on your own*
2. Motors
3. Wheels
4. Battery Pack
5. Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)
6. Remote Control Transmitter and Receiver
7. Microcontroller (Arduino)
8. Motor Driver
9. Various Screws and Connectors. 

# Construction Steps

The construction of the RC car involves several key steps, including chassis assembly, electronics setup, programming, remote control configuration, testing, fine-tuning, customization, and final assembly. Check the [Construction Steps](CONSTRUCTION.md) document for detailed instructions.

# Features

- **Modular Design:** The project is structured in a modular fashion, allowing for easy customization and upgrades.
- **Programming Flexibility:** Utilizes popular microcontroller for programming flexibility (Arduino).
- **Customization Options:** Encourages users to personalize their RC car with a customized frame and body.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RC Car Project, follow these steps:

1. Refer to the [Construction Steps] document for detailed instructions on building the RC car.

2. Explore the code in the `src` directory for programming the microcontroller.

3. Customize the RC car by adding your own flair to the frame and body.
